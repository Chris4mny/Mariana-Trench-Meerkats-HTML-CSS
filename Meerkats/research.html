<h1>Reason research is needed</h1><br><br>


<p class="indented">Research is needed to learn more about the unknown center of the Earth to better understand what Earth's core is made up. Right now, scientists have only speculated what the deepest part of Earth's makeup is, but with GPS and video on the meerkats, we can finally see Earth's core for the first time. Researcher also believe with the knowledge of the Earth’s core it can give answers to how Earth was formed, which is a question that has been baffling scientist for centuries.

<h1>Mariana Trench Meerkats have unique identifiers</h1><br><br>

<p class="indented">Meerkats are unique like Orcas in they have a one of a kind identifiers on their fur coats. All the meerkat's images were captured on the submarines camera system, which has been run through our AI system, where they were measured with millions of points and given an identifier. No two meerkats have the same id, and researchers have stated that they can tell the differences with the human eye relatively quickly.

<h1>How you can help?</h1><br><br>

<p class="indented">You have the opportunity to adopt a meerkat while raising money for the research team. When you select a Meerkat, you will receive up to date information on the newest discoveries and will receive up to date photos of your Meerkat. 
The cost of adopting a meerkat is $29.99 per month, and you will receive our monthly newsletter at no additional charge. Also, you will receive a calendar with photos of all the meerkats in their natural habitat.
