<h1>Discovering the Meerkats</h1><br><br>



<p class="indented">Discovering the meerkats was not the initial mission. The team was exploring the deepest known location on Earth when the discovery was made in the Mariana Trench. The discovery was noticed by former astronaut Clyde Moon. Moon stated, "at first sight, I thought I was hallucinating… is that a meerkat?". This shocking discovery has opened a whole new level of exploration and presents an opportunity to explore unexpected avenues of the Earth.

<h1>Can they dig through the center of the Earth?</h1><br><br>

<p class="indented">Researchers want to follow a Meerkat on a journey through the center of the earth. The team believes they can dig through the earth’s core, but the results are unknown at this point. Researcher are hoping to capture a meerkat to attach a GPS and video unit for tracking, which may unlock a series of hidden tunnels.

<h1>How do they breathe?</h1><br><br>

<p class="indented">Scientist believe they breathe by going into tunnels where oxygen is available. But the team is only speculating and hopes to find out the answer during their research. Researchers are not ruling out a gill system without first checking the anatomy of the meerkats. Some other opinions are they have adapted to hold their breath for days on end.
