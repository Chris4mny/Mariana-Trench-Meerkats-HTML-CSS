	<meta name="description" content="The mysterious Mariana Trench meerkats and how they have evolved into a vital part of the ecosystem in the Mariana trench. How they can through the earth’s core and go from an aquatic environment to a land-based. Researchers are on the brink of being able to place GPS and cameras on the Meerkats to get a better look at their paths that may go through the center of the earth.">

<h1>Mission Statement</h1>

<p class="indented">Our mission is to explore all ends of the ocean to better understand our ecosystem. The discovery of the Meerkats will better assist us with exploration into areas that are impossible for humans to enter. By utilizing the Meerkats, we want to be able to prove or disprove what we have thought about Earth's core, and possibly discover new species that may have never been found.
</p>

<h1>About our research team</h1>

<p class="indented">Our research team is utilizing the best technology to explore the depth of the ocean. It is made up of many different fields of scientists such as marine biologists, zoologists, botanists, and a former astronaut who is a physicist. The team now could utilize the discovery of the Mariana Meerkats to investigate unknown territories below the oceans floor.

<p class="indented">They utilize the <a href="ResearchVessel.png" alt="research vessel" title="research vessel" target="_blank">galaxy 8000 submarine</a> to go to previously impossible depths. The galaxy 8000 can sustain depths of ten miles, holds a crew of thirteen people, and can stay underwater for three weeks before having to resurface.
